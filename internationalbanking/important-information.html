                Not all products, services or investments described on this Site are available in all jurisdictions and some are available on a limited basis only, due to local regulatory and legal requirements. Any investment information which may be provided on this Site is also provided for illustration only. No investment information on this Site should be construed as a solicitation or offer, or recommendation, to acquire or dispose of any investment or to engage in any other transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Illustrations of the likely risk and reward properties of possible portfolios and investments on this Site are not specific advice about any investment and you should not rely on them. Any illustrations are accurate at the time of writing, and may be subject to change.
              </p>
              <p>
                The recommendations made for your actual portfolio might differ from any asset allocation or strategies outlined on this Site. Please ensure that your portfolio is updated or redefined when your investment objectives or personal circumstances change.
              </p>
              <p>
                The value of the investments which may be stated on this Site, and the income from them, may fall as well as rise. Past performance of investments is no guide to future performance. You may not get back the amount of capital you invest. Any income projections and yields are estimated and are included for indication only. Further, any valuations given on this Site may not accurately reflect the values at which investments may actually be bought or sold and no allowance has been made for taxation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data which may be found on this Site is based on quantitative research and analysis of historic data using current and proposed asset weightings and proprietary projections of expected returns and estimates of future volatility. Data does not reflect actual trading, liquidity constraints, fees and other costs. It should not be taken as a forecast or estimate of likely future returns. As illustrations do not take into account fees and commissions, or taxation, the actual performance of any investment might be more or less than is stated in any illustration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Risk warnings are provided for your information and protection. We strongly encourage you to read them and to contact us if you have any questions about the features or risks of any investment or service.

                We do not provide any legal or tax advice and recommend that you obtain your own independent legal advice and independent tax advice, tailored to your particular circumstances. In order to provide you with information on our products and services, we may explain to you our understanding of the general tax position relating to them. We do not assume any legal responsibility for anyone acting on the information provided, and as tax law is subject to frequent change your position should be checked with an independent professional advisor.

                Risk warnings about borrowing
              </h3>
              <p>
                If a loan is denominated in a currency other than Sterling, changes in the exchange rate driven by market fluctuations beyond our control may increase the Sterling equivalent of the debt. For loans secured on property, the Barclays Group will require a first charge over the property. <strong>Your property may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                As a responsible lender, we only want you to borrow what you can afford, and in a way that is best for you. When considering your application, your financial circumstances will be assessed before we make a decision to lend money. And remember, if you should run into any difficulties please contact us as soon as you become aware of them.

              </p>
              <p>
                DEPOSITS MADE WITH THE GUERNSEY BRANCHES OF BARCLAYS PRIVATE CLIENTS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED AND BARCLAYS BANK PLC ARE COVERED BY THE DEPOSITORS COMPENSATION SCHEME.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a licensed Bank in Guernsey, Barclays Private Clients International Limited, Guernsey branch and Barclays Bank PLC, Guernsey branch are participants in the Guernsey Banking Deposit Compensation Scheme (&quot;GBDCS&quot;) established by The Banking Deposit Compensation Scheme (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Ordinance, 2008 (the &quot;Ordinance&quot;). The following is a brief summary of the GBDCS, but is not intended as a substitute for the actual wording of the Ordinance, a copy of which is available on request.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The&#160;GBDCS only applies to &#39;qualifying deposits&#39;, which broadly means deposits made by natural persons for their own benefit; with a few limited exceptions such as, for example, deposits made by trustees of retirement annuity trust schemes, the&#160;GBDCS does not apply to companies, trusts, partnerships or charities.
                </li>
                <li>The&#160;GBDCS will provide compensation in the event that a Licensed Bank is unable to repay its depositors. Payment will be made within 3 months of a valid claim form.
                </li>
                <li>Compensation is limited to a maximum of &#163;50,000 per individual claimant; in the case of a joint account each depositor would be entitled.
                </li>
                <li>Total&#160;GBDCS compensation in any five year period is limited to &#163;100 million. If this limit was exceeded, compensation would be reduced pro rata. The cap also means that compensation in respect of any one bank cannot exceed &#163;100 million.
                </li>
                <li>The amount payable may be reduced if the Bank has any contractual right of set-off against the account. The GBDCS is entitled to recover compensation from any funds subsequently paid out by the Bank.
                </li>
              
              </ul>
              <p>
                Investment: Guernsey has a Compensation of Investors Scheme which provides protection to eligible investors when a compensation event occurs in class A schemes. There is no compensation scheme covering investors in class B schemes, class Q schemes or closed ended funds. A compensation event occurs whenever the Commission is satisfied that a scheme participant is in default, has an eligible liability to the investor and is unable, or likely to be unable, to meet that liability in whole or in part.
              </p>
              <p>
                An investor&#39;s application for compensation must be submitted to the Commission less than 6 months after the investor became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the default. The Commission may reduce the amount payable by way of compensation in certain circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sum payable to an investor as compensation is limited as follows:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>where the total amount of the defaulting participant&#39;s liabilities to the investor does not exceed &#163;50,000, the maximum payable is 90% of those liabilities;
                </li>
                <li>where that total amount exceeds &#163;50,000 but does not exceed &#163;100,000, the maximum payable is &#163;45,000 plus 30% of so much of that total amount as exceeds &#163;50,000;
                </li>
                <li>where that total amount exceeds &#163;100,000, the maximum payable is &#163;60,000;
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The maximum amount which the Commission may determine should be paid by way of compensation, together with interest payable in any compensation year is the amount determined by the Commission as an amount which may be expected not to cause the total net compensation costs for that year to exceed &#163;5,000,000.
